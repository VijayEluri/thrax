Thrax is designed to extract a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) from an
aligned parallel corpus. If you don't know what that means, you probably don't
need Thrax.

Thrax currently has support for both Hiero-style grammars (with a single
non-terminal symbol) and SAMT-style grammars (where non-terminal symbols are
calculated by projecting onto the span from a target-side parse tree).

COMPILING:
To compile the code, type

    ant

At the end of the compilation, ant should report that the build was successful.

RUNNING THRAX:
Thrax can be invoked with

    thrax <configuration file>

Some example configuration files have been included with this distribution:

    example/hiero.conf
    example/samt.conf
