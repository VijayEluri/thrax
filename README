Thrax is designed to extract a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) from an
aligned parallel corpus. If you don't know what that means, you probably don't
need Thrax.

COMPILING:
At the moment there's no code, but once there is, it will be written in Java.
To compile the code, type

	ant

At the end of the compilation, ant should report that the build was successful.

RUNNING THRAX:
Thrax can be invoked with

	thrax
