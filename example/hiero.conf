### GRAMMAR OPTIONS
###

grammar     hiero   # or samt
# default-nt    X   # X is the default anyway

# not only do these next six options have the suggested values as given
# in Chiang's "Hierarchical Phrase-based Translation" (CL), they are also
# Thrax's default values! You could comment them out and the resulting grammar
# would be identical.

initial-phrase-length   10  # maximum length of initial phrase pairs
rule-source-length      5   # maximum number of symbols on rule's source side
arity                   2   # maximum number of NTs in a rule
lexicality              1   # minimum number of aligned terminals in a rule
adjacent-nts    false   # allow adjacent nonterminals on source side
loose           false   # allow unaligned words at boundaries of phrases

features        phrase  lex  # a whitespace seperated list of features
                             # in this example, the features are phrase
                             # translation probability
                             # and lexical probability

output-format   joshua  # the only option and default
                        # later we will want to add formats for other decoders
                        # such as moses and cdec, if they use other formats

label-feature-scores true   # label feature scores?
                            # each score will be output as name=score

work-dir /tmp/thrax # where to hold intertmediate files on
                    # local disk
hadoop-work-dir file:///tmp/thrax/hadoop-work # where to hold files
                                              # such as job output
